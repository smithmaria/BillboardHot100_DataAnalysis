# Billboard Hot 100 Data Analysis

### 1. Setup Environment

Use classroom conda environment called `IT2053C`. If you don't have it, you can create it by running the following command:

```bash
# You must provide your 6+2 username
python scripts/setup.py --username <your_6+2_username>

# Example:
python scripts/setup.py --username gilanyym
```

Go back to the previous assignment to make sure you have set up the environment correctly.

Now, you can activate the environment in the terminal by running the following command:

```bash
# Activate your conda environment
conda activate IT2053C
```
